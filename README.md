Zelda Hangman

Overview

    A Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild themed hangman game. 
    It was created as an assignment for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. 
    It features Javascript which enables the site to be interactive and dynamic, 
    as well as HTML for the bones of the web page and CSS for the styling of the game. 
    I hope you enjoy!

Requirements:

    Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

    Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

    Display the following on the page:

    Press any key to get started!

    Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

        * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

        * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

    Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

    Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

    After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
